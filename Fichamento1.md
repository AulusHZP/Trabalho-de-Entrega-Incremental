## 1. Fichamento de Conteúdo
*"Data-driven intelligent predictive maintenance (IPdM) offers potential solutions to satisfy the urgent demand of predicting impending failures and mitigating unplanned downtime of industrial machinery, and is envisioned as a critical enabler for future industrial Internet of Things"
*"In this section, we will make a comprehensive review about the DL techniques used for the IPdM, including RNNs, CNNs, attention mechanism, and GANs. The corresponding model structures are shown in the Fig. 3"​
*"Finally, some insights about future trends and challenges of IPdM has been discussed"​
*"In particular, the AWE dataset has been published on Github website for opening research, and a DL-based case study has been conducted to demonstrate how to build an IPdM model using the AWE dataset"

* _RNNs:_ "a single-layer RNNs performs representation learning just via one hidden unit in the physical level"​.
* _CNNs:_"CNNs is also a kind of feed-forward NNs with convolutional computation and deep structure, which is provided with the characteristics of local connection and weight sharing"​.
* _Attention Mechanism:_  "attention mechanism is combined with other deep models, such as a RNNs or CNNs, to enhance the capability of capturing global dependencies".​
* _GANs:_ "the GANs consists of two models: a generative model G that captures the hidden information and data distribution, and a discriminative model D"​.
* _AESGRU:_ "As shown in Fig. 6, we use an existing deep model of our previous work, named AESGRU, the specific model structure is depicted in [51], which is composed of a bidirectional GRU network and enhanced with the attention mechanism".

* _"Data-driven intelligent predictive maintenance (IPdM) offers potential solutions to satisfy the urgent demand of predicting impending failures and mitigating unplanned downtime ofindustrial machinery, and is envisioned as a critical enabler for future industrial Internet of Things."_
* _"First of all, four mainstream algorithms of DL are reviewed around the specific IPdM applications of recent five years"._
* _" it can be found that the AESGRU gets a 97.475% diagnostic accuracy on the AWEdataset, and the prediction distributions of the testing set is shown in Fig. 8"_
* _"the attention mechanism is combined with other deep models, such as a RNNs or CNNs, to enhance the capability of capturing global dependencies. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the attention is deployed behind a bi-RNNs (it can also be a single directional RNNs) with any types of units, such as the LSTM and GRU unit."_
